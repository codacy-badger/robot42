[Vik Ramanujam](https://vik.ramanuj.am)'s take on the toy robot.

Please have a look at [the test file](https://github.com/piggyslasher/robot42/blob/master/src/robot.test.js) to see assertions.

I've moved out most logic into a Utils file so that you could apply the movement logic to pretty much anything like a car or a human.

To test, run:
```shell
npm i && npm test
```
or
```shell
yarn && yarn test
```

The robot can also be controlled after instantiated. You can play about with in in the run.js.

You can get make Robot42 do what you want it to:

```javascript
import Robot42 from './robot'

const example2 = `
    PLACE 0,0,NORTH
    RIGHT
    MOVE
    REPORT
`
const robot42 = new Robot42(example2)

// robot42 is not done yet

robot42.do(`
    PLACE 1,2,EAST
    MOVE
    MOVE
    LEFT
    MOVE
    REPORT
`)

robot42.report(true); // signifies that you want to see a visual output
